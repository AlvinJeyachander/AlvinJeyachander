ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alvin

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in DATA WORLD!!

I've always been fascinated by the power of data to shape a cooler, better world. Digging into data and pulling out insights is like my favorite kind of treasure hunt. I'm a super motivated data analyst, and I'm all about solving problems and making sure everyone's on the same page.

Started with a degree in Electrical Engineering and then did the whole MS in Information Assurance thing. Worked at TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES, doing the data analyst dance for a big North American insurance player. Now, I'm kicking it as a Data Analyst at U.S. Bank, where I'm not just about solving puzzles for companies, but also trying to bring some good vibes to society through the magic of data.

My skillset includes:

Languages: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL (MySQL), R (ggplot2, dplyr, caret), MATLAB
Software: RStudio, Jupyter, MySQL, Tableau, Power BI, Adobe Analytics, JIRA/Confluence, Excel, PowerPoint
